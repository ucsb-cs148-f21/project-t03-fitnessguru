Purpose and Intended Audience of Fitness Guru:
	
Our app, Fitness Guru is intended for people who actively go to the gym or are trying to get started on working out. The purpose of our application is to help our users create custom workouts and splits, so that our users could become more organized with their workout journey. The application also helps our users keep track of their progress in the exercises they choose to keep track of. Specifically, their progress is tracked by the users logging in the weights they used for certain exercises and repetition count they chose to keep track of and then using that data, the user is displayed a line chart that is visually easy to analyze. Overall, the goal of the application is to deliver the intended audience a source to keep track and organize their fitness journey.

On this page, users will be able to see splits that have been copied down from the PublicSplits page, but will not be able to modify any of the workouts. However, users do have the ability to change the split name and split notes even though there will still be a clear label indicating that the split was copied.

Public Splits Page:

Users will be able to see all the splits that have been created and made public by other users using Fitness Guru.
Users can copy public splits by clicking on the “Copy” button and that copied split will appear in the My Splits page.

My Weights Page:

From the exercises listed on the My Exercises, users can choose any of those exercises and any amount of repetitions per set to keep track of.
Once a user adds an exercise and repetition amount to keep track of, users can start adding weights used at the gym.
For every weight amount that is inputted by the user for any exercise, the date in which that weight was punched in will be recorded with that weight. This setup will help create the line charts in the progress page.

ProgressPage
In the progress page, users can select from any of the exercises and repetition amount that the user chose to keep track of in the My Weights page.
Once the user selects an exercise and a repetition amount, a line chart forms in which the y axis is the weight amount(from the weights registered by the user) and the x axis is the dates in which the weights were inputted. Therefore, the further down we go in the x-axis, the closer we get to today’s date. 
The line chart generated is very helpful for the user to see a visual representation of how they have performed in their weightlifting journey. Users can see how quickly they have moved up or down in weight based on the steepness of the slopes we see in the line chart.
