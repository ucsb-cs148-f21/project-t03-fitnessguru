Purpose and Intended Audience of Fitness Guru:

Our app, Fitness Guru is intended for people who actively go to the gym or are trying to get started on working out. The purpose of our application is to help our users create custom workouts and splits, so that our users could become more organized with their workout journey. The application also helps our users keep track of their progress in the exercises they choose to keep track of. Specifically, their progress is tracked by the users logging in the weights they used for certain exercises and repetition count they chose to keep track of and then using that data, the user is displayed a line chart that is visually easy to analyze.
