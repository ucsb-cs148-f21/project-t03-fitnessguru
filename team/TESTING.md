Testing Approach of FitnessGuru

1)
For our unit test requirement from the previous lab, we used the react testing library and we tested the home page of our app. 
This unit test assures that the home page renders without crashing.
2)
Going forward, I believe we will only use unit tests to test functions that are essential to the functionaility of our application because 
we plan on using higher level testing instead. We are restricted with time and we think higher level tests will be more benificial for us to 
determine weather the user functionility componenets function well in the user's point of view.
