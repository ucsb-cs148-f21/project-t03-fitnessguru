# Testing Approach of FitnessGuru

1)
For our unit test requirement from the previous lab, we used the react testing library and we tested the home page of our app. 
This unit test assures that the home page renders without crashing.

2)
Going forward, given the time constraint, I believe we will not go forward with unit tests to test functions and components. Instead, we plan on using higher level testing. We are restricted with time and we think higher level tests will be more benificial for us to determine weather the user functionility 
componenets function well in the user's point of view.
