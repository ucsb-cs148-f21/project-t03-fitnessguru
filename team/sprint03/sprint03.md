Current User Story:

As someone who frequents the gym, I can create a new custom workout, so that I have several workouts to choose from.

* Connect weight charts page to backend
* Have API that fetches data from exercises that we want
* Get started working on making some workouts/exercises public so people can use them
* Add testing framework
