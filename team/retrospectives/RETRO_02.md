# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/2021

* Led by: Martin Cabello
* Present: Kevin, John, Mikey
* Absent: Hima
## Retro Notes:
1. Set the Stage: What have you done really well in the last iteration?
  - Kevin: "Helping with whatever he could. Checking pull requests, merge conflicts"
  - Mikey: "Good job in understand how to connect the frontend with the backend" "Adapted pretty quickly, understanding how the routes work"
  - John: "Learning what I can, havent done any backend. I feel like I've learend a lot with the backend"
2. Gather Data: Brainstorm what to repeat and what behaviors to avoid
  - We are doing these things well:
    - Getting a good amount done for an MVP, foundation set up, so everything should be a lot faster to improve the site.
    - Better job at communicating.
  - We should avoid these behaviors:
    - More peer/code review before merging branches!
    - More clear acceptance criterion for issues
    - More clear on things on the board, make sure what each person is doing.
3. Generate Insights: What would make the next iteration a 10/10?
  - Everyone completes their issues with code reviews by the end of the iteration.
  - Someone dedicated to CSS/ Styling all around the website.
4. Decide What To Do: Make definite plan of action for next Iteration
  - Allocate issues to everyone on the team in an even matter!
  - If issues are related, communicate.
  - Text group chat when you have a pull request ready to be reviewed.
  - If group needs a zoom/in person meeting because they arent 100% focused, do it!
5. Close The Retrospective: Smilies
  - Kevin: :)                                                                
  - Mikey:  :)                                                                
  - John: :)

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
  - I used the Darby/Larson 5-step retro with prompts from retromat.org. The process can be seen above.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
  - It went very well. All the group members were engaged and provided valuable insights.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
  - Come prepared. Write out the prompts for the retro before the meeting, and follow your pre-made schedule. Getting ideas from retromat.org was helpful.
