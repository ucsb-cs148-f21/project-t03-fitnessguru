## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

  - It went very well. All the group members were engaged and provided valuable insights.

  - Come prepared. Write out the prompts for the retro before the meeting, and follow your pre-made schedule. Getting ideas from retromat.org was helpful.
