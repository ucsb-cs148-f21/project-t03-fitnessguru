# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/2021

-   Led by: John Judge

## Retro Notes:
1. Things that we should start doing: 
- Mikey: Communicating more with people whose issues coincide with yours, make sure closely related topics are communicating
- Hima: Take on work that we can complete in the deadline, improve on what we already have
- Martin: Meeting more on Zoom, especially over Thanksgiving break
- Kevin: Pass
3. Things that we think we should stop doing: 
- Kevin: Focus on completing the issues we currently have as opposed to creating new issues
- Mikey: Documenting code better, stop writing spaghetti code
- Martin: Still make pages even if they don't like nice
- Hima: Stop adding so many pages, clean up navbar 
4. Things that we think we should continue doing:
  - Hima: good job of communication and being on track with the project
  - Mikey: Continue having multiple people to check pull requests
  - Martin: Continue asking mentors for help if you get stuck
  - Kevin: Continue communicating with each other, having multiple people to check pull requests
## Action item

-   a goal: Focus in on important parts of the project as we near the deadline
-   a change: Don't make a ton of new issues, focus in on important issues, delete pages that are not important
-   a measurement: We can keep track of important issues completed, limit number of new issues created

## Retro Assessment

-   A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
    -   Start/Stop/Continue - everyone contributes 1 thing they want the group to start,stop, and continue
-   What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
    -  Definitely come prepared and have concrete goals for what you want to accomplish during the retro
- I think it went pretty well, getting new ideas out and making sure we are focused for the next iteration
