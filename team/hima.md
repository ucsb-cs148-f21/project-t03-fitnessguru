My name is Hima and I am a 4th year Computer Science student.
My idea for the project is to create a web app that allows the user
to log in their different weights and keep track of their scheduled daily workouts.
I am also thinking it would be nice to have access to tutorial or some information on
how to properly perform certain exercises, since it is very easy to have bad
form and get injured.
