## Action item

1. Set the Stage: What have you done really well in the last iteration?
  - Kevin: "Keeping track of what we need to get done and what requirements need to be made. Good at keeping track of progression."  
  - Martin: "Making sure that I look through the labs, and confirming that we are completing all the necessary items in order to recieve full points."
  - Hima: "Done a good job of learning the new technologies needed, and communicating with my teammates in order to understand the necessary information for this project."
  - John: "Getting up to speed on React and NextJS. In general, doing a good job of getting myself up to working speed with the technologies."
2. Gather Data: Brainstorm what to repeat and what behaviors to avoid
  - We are doing these things well:
    - When we are together, we communicate well
    - We help eachother when we are together
    - Assigning issues to different people so that we aren't all working on the same things
  - We should avoid these behaviors:
    - Lack of communication when we aren't meeting in person
    - Not sharing resources that might help other teammates
    - Merge to main branch without having people double check our work
3. Generate Insights: What would make the next iteration a 10/10?
  - Share resources between eachother
  - Meeting in person more frequently
  - Don't be afraid to ask for help
  - Get more done. (we don't need to spend as much time learnign. Prep work is done.)
  - Be very clear on what we are trying to accomplish by specific deadlines (don't let things float. Be specific)
4. Decide What To Do: Make definite plan of action for next Iteration
  - Set deadlines for when we want specific issues to be completed by.
  - Dedicate 1 or 2 extra days during the week for the team to meet in person or on zoom
  - Prioritize which user stories to implement first, and which issues should be worked on.
  - Casual scrum meetings over groupchat to see how everyone is progressing.
5. Close The Retrospective: Smilies
  - Kevin: :)                                                                      
  - Martin: :)                                                                     
  - Hima: :)                                                                       
  - John: :)

* a goal: Communicate better outside of class
* a change: Meet outside of class
* a measurement: The amount of issues closed by their specific deadlines.

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
  - I used the Darby/Larson 5-step retro with prompts from retromat.org. The process can be seen above.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
  - It went very well. All the group members were engaged and provided valuable insights.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
  - Come prepared. Write out the prompts for the retro before the meeting, and follow your pre-made schedule. Getting ideas from retromat.org was helpful.
