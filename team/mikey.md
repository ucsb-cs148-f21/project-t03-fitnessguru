**About Me**
I'm a third year CS major, and I am looking forward to working on this project!
In my free time I like to workout, surf, and do photography.

**Ideas for This Project**
I would like to make an application that allows for us to log different workouts
and lets people keep track of their progress. I think something cool that we could
implement if we have time, would be adding a social media aspect to our app, where
users can share their different workouts and their progress.
